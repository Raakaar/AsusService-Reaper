## 🧭 Overview

**Cerulean Reaper** is a PowerShell-based defensive utility designed to detect and neutralize rogue ASUS background services, drivers, and scheduled tasks that can trigger unwanted system shutdowns—especially those caused by phantom alerts linked to high-end ASUS BIOS-integrated components.

The utility deploys a **boot-time SYSTEM-level scheduled task** that proactively disables:

- ASUS service processes (e.g., asus_framework, atkexComSvc)
- Fan and sensor control daemons (AsusFanControlService)
- Preloaded shutdown triggers initiated by wininit.exe
- ASUS-linked scheduled tasks and update trapshooks

---

## ⚠️ What Problem Does It Solve?

Systems with ASUS motherboards—especially those involving custom water loops, AIOs, or heavy ASUS software integration—may experience **automated shutdowns triggered by false leak, thermal, or pump alerts**, often without user consent or visible cause.

Certain ASUS motherboards—particularly those used in enthusiast builds with water cooling, AIOs, or Armoury Crate—may experience unexpected, clean shutdowns triggered by false thermal, pump, or leak alerts.

- Typical symptoms include:

-- Sudden shutdowns logged as:
--- The process wininit.exe (127.0.0.1) has initiated the shutdown...
--- Reason Code: 0x80070000 (Legacy API shutdown)
-- Kernel Event ID 41 or 1074
-- Event Log codes: 1074 or Kernel-Power 41
-- No Windows Update, task, or user action responsible

Cerulean Reaper neutralizes these conditions before they can take effect..

## 🔐 Security Justification

Even after uninstalling Armoury Crate, ASUS's embedded services may persist and expose a security risk. Disabling these services not only stabilizes the system—it reduces your attack surface by neutralizing vectors tied to known vulnerabilities.
