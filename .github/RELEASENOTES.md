# Cerulean Reaper v1.1.1 â€“ Targeted Stability + Robust Logging

This update refines Cerulean Reaperâ€™s ability to reliably neutralize problematic ASUS services that trigger shutdowns due to false water leak alerts on ROG motherboards.

### ðŸš€ What's New

- **Elevation Detection and Auto-Relaunch**  
  Script now detects non-admin execution and auto-relaunches with elevated permissions.

- **Robust Logging with Rotation & Archiving**  
  - Logs are now saved in `%ProgramData%\ASUS-Reaper`
  - Automatically archives logs beyond 30
  - Deletes oldest archived logs if count exceeds 100

- **Non-Destructive Logging Function**  
  Unified `Log()` function used throughout the script to capture all actions and errors.

- **Retry Logic for Service Control**  
  Now attempts to disable stubborn services up to 5 times before giving up.

- **Task Cleanup**  
  Removes ASUS-related scheduled tasks using `Unregister-ScheduledTask`.

- **Script Failures Now Surface Clearly**  
  User-friendly message boxes appear when deployment or task registration fails.
